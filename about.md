I'm Cyril Lacote. I do software for a living.
I live in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and work at [Adyen](https://adyen.com) as a Java Developer.
Before that, I co-founded the collaborative company [Ninja Squad](https://ninja-squad.com),
and the tech conference [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org) in Lyon, France
where I used to live.
