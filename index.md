Hi, I'm Cyril Lacote.

![Cyril Lacote](/assets/cyril.jpg)

I do software for a living.
I live in Amsterdam, Netherlands with my family,
and work at [Adyen](https://adyen.com) as a Java Developer.

Before that, I had been working in Lyon, France where I co-founded the
collaborative company [Ninja Squad](https://ninja-squad.com)
(I was CEO, Chief Emoji Officer),
and the tech conference [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org).

My girlfriend is (the famous) [Agnès Crépet](https://agnescrepet.org).
Our sons are Marius and Lucien.

Before having kids, we had the chance to travel the world and meet other developers.
We reported about this experience in [a talk](https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2016/11/24/keynote-codeurs-en-seine/).
